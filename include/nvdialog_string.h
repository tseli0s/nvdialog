/**
 * @brief A string type that can be resized, manipulated, converted and read from.
 * 
 * `NvdDynamicString` is a recent addition to the library that allows various kinds of strings
 * across various operating systems to be abstracted and represented by a single type. Whereas `const char*` is
 * widely used throughout the library, an `NvdDynamicString` is useful when strings are returned - Simple character literals cannot
 * be returned since they are allocated on the stack. It is also simple to use and convert from and to `char` buffers, making it
 * compatible with almost all existing APIs.
 * @note Do not pass this to any parameters that require a `char*` without explicit conversion (See `nvd_string_to_cstr()`).
 * @note Internally, this dynamic string maintains a capacity variable, that may allocate more memory than needed to store the string. This is done to avoid multiple allocations.
 * @since v0.10.0
 * @ingroup String
