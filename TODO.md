# NvDialog: TODOs
This is a compiled example of features that are planned to be added to NvDialog before hitting release v1.0.
You can read the [contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to implement any of these and contribute to NvDialog's development. In other words, this is a roadmap to the first stable release.

- [ ] Android backend*.
- [ ] Close all issues and fix any known bugs so far.
- [ ] Rewrite the [CMakeLists.txt](./CMakeLists.txt) file since it's very messy and cluttered.
- [ ] Optimizations for GNOME.
- [ ] Improved `libadwaita` support on GNU/Linux.
