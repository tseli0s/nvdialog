===nvd-demo===
nvd-demo is, as the name suggests, a tiny demo application for nvdialog. Apart from showcasing various features, it is also used to ensure consistent behaviour between different platforms and good compatibility. In other words, it's the "testing ground" of nvdialog.

nvd-demo doesn't have any functionality of its own; It doesn't open its own windows nor does it do anything else. It just starts showing dialogs and sending notifications as soon as it boots.
